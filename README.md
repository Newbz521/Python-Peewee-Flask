# Python Command Line Application

To learn Python and SQL, you'll be building a command line application!

## Prerequisites

- Python
- SQL and PeeWee

## Instructions

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise)
1. Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Your submission is due by the deadline on your cohort calendar. Submit your
project by creating an issue on this repository.

## Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

1. Run without errors
1. Built in Python, use a SQL database with PeeWee models
1. Include a README written in well formatted Markdown (_hint: look up a README
   template_)
1. Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of
   small commits

## Project Ideas

Pick one of the following project ideas and implement it with Python, through
the command line. You can use `argparse` or a framework for your command line
application. [Read more
here](https://realpython.com/comparing-python-command-line-parsing-libraries-argparse-docopt-click/).

> If you have an idea for something else you'd like to build, you must run it by
> an instructor first.

### Flash cards

A user should be able to create new cards. They should be able to set up
a training session, pick the number of cards they'd like to review and then see
that many cards. For each card, they should be presented with the "front" and
then asked for the "back". Keep track of how many times a card has been answered
correctly and incorrectly.

### Contact Book

Users should be able to create new contacts. They should be able to
see a list of contacts in their contact book. They should be able to find
a contact by the contact's first name.

### Bookmark Collector

Users should be able to add new bookmarks (links). They should be able to see
a list of their bookmarks by the webpage title and see the details of that
bookmark. They should be able to find bookmarks by name/title of the webpage.

### Note Taker

Users sould be able to create notes with titles and contents. They should be
able to see a list of their notes and select and view a specific note.

## Bonus

Once you have the command line version working consider the following bonuses:

1. Get Update and Delete working
1. Build a user interface with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), or [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
1. Use web scraping to pull data from a webpage using [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
